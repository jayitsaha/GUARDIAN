## Project Summary

GUARDIAN: AI-Powered Safety and Vigilance

GUARDIAN is an AI-driven platform empowering citizens to protect their communities. 
Using image recognition, real-time data, and Generative AI, it enables instant incident 
reporting for swift responses from authorities, bridging the gap between communities and first responders.

Its intelligent algorithms continuously adapt, enhancing the detection of risks 
and prediction of emerging threats, fostering a safer, cleaner, and 

more connected urban environment.

Key features:
1. Smart Personal Safety Routes: Recommends safer routes using real-time crime data, 
lighting, and crowd density, especially benefiting vulnerable groups like women and children at night.
2. Real-Time Risk Alerts & Geo-Fencing: Monitors environmental risks (e.g., pollution, protests, crime) 
and alerts users, suggesting safer alternatives for informed decision-making.
3. SOS Emergency Response: Includes an SOS button for immediate notifications to emergency contacts, 
ensuring quick assistance in distress.

GUARDIAN continuously learns and evolves, safeguarding communities with precision and promoting a more vigilant society.
